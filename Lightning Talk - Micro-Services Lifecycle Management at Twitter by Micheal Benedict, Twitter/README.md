大家好，我是Micheal。今天谈论的主题是: 在大规模场景下的微服务管理的挑战。我很难把这些知识浓缩到5分钟内讲完，在我演讲之后，如果有关于演讲内容的任何问题，请在Twitter上@Micheal与我联系。我不打算深入介绍实现细节，但我想分享一下我从Twitter成千上万个服务的管理中学到的收获。

这一定不是一件令人惊讶的事儿：Twitter曾经在轨道上运行一次最大的Ruby on Rails安装，最长的一次被形象的称为“单轨铁路”。由于路由演示和业务逻辑本身紧密耦合在一起，它让业务变得越来越难以扩容、调试和工作。"单轨铁路”的问题引发了解耦，“单体应用”需要分拆成多个独立的服务。今天Twitter的服务实际上由一千多个子服务构成。大家看到的这幅特殊的图片展示了一个特定的请求通过Twitter的反向代理——TFE路由到不同的服务上。

有趣的是，微服务化使我们能过很容易实现右边列出的优势，例如容错、优雅的降级这些对服务来说最重要的特性。团队通过计划、扩展独立的服务进而提高开发人员的生产率，让团队发挥更大的价值而不需要每个开发人员依赖那么依赖其他人才能开展工作。然而有一些很多人不知道的，并且随着时间我们逐渐意识到的，一些挑战并没有我们想象那么明显。例如：面向服务的架构（SOA）确实为区分边界和所有权提供了一定程度上的舒适度，但他只是在组织保持不变的情况下才有效。

service-oriented architecture did provieds a certain level of comfort around fencing and ownernership,however it is only valid when the organization stays intact not many organizations stay that way there's always constant turn reorganizations and many things happening projects moving from one to be

impact both on the business from an Operations perspective as well as the efficiency perspective the second challenge is about managing metadata in general are sorry and the ops team really appreciate a single consolidated view of everything that is critical to run the business this enables them to monitor and detect manage incidents and recover effectively this however becomes a challenge when the organization actually grows from a few teams to about hundred-plus teams because there's a need for a centralized service discovery service directory and metadata management system where you can store important metrics such as tier information you're monitoring dashboards slo-moes and different queries where many are developers from the organization query and use them. We also ran into one fo the biggest problems that is the ability to identify a service using a canonical identifier i'm sure many people deploying our services onto pulic clouds or even hybrid stragegies well we'll be able to appreciate that problem because not everyone uses the same name and their provisioning resources on these public clouds we didn't have identified provisioning early on which led to every service having disparity identities across our infrastructure usually orgamizations can map or consolidate all these identifies through various programs which will last for a couple of weeks manual mappings of these ideas together but unfortunately this is a significant tax and engineering doing these cycles again and again adds to a lot of manual work which we wanted avoid the worst part is by the time this manual work is done this very good chance
that all of those data you collected and mapped have gone out of date and finally the lack of consistent rate of provision and management manage resource as well is very important to provision resources and tied to individual teams such that quarters utilization met utilization metering managing the various clients all become extremely simple what happened for a single place this enables us to do some really fancy things to tell us how much does the services costs to run how much does a team x spend on certain infrastructure resources and moving on so i think we can consolidate this into two big teams essentially the platform operators it is that we're definitely needed tools to operate and manage their service for the customers and service owners themselves needed an end-to-end lifecycle manager where they can go into a single console view the projects and manage them repectively and that led to us buliding somethings called the tight services lifecycle manager so just quickly wrap this up you can argue that we start off with the data center of the pulic cloud 

where individual platform teams may run managed solutions or even use solutions which offered by the public cloud themselves we build specific provider api's and adapters to enable these individual services which air which solve the problem of identity management single place to provision porter and do utilization metrics and even charge users and teams within this coupled with specific service lifecycle workflows which enable them to create build deploy their services along with the whole different side of reporting engine which shows how much does it cost to run your service are happening through a single dashboard and to just give you a particular example of what this may look like is this is one of the chargeback bills we sent out two or three team unfortunately not show any of the dollar figures but really this is the level of detail
